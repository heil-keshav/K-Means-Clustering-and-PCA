1. Main script files are the following:
	l4a.m
	l4b.m
	l4c.m
	calc_kmean.m

2. calc_kmean.m calculates the confusion matrix and classification accuracy and returns both of them. Input arguments required are- data, label and value of k i.e number of clusters to be formed.

3. Run l4a.m to perform task a). This will generate three files K_10, K_15, K_5.txt representing the cconfusion matrix for respective k value and classification accuracy in the last line of file.

4. Run l4b.m to perform task b). This will create a file data_low_dim.txt which is required before running the task c). Make sure that this file is generated before performing task c).

6. Run l4c.m to perform task c). This will return the data files similar to task a).
